This story is a story about people and my subconscious. I lost social connections, I did things that I would've never thought I could do. Its as if someone was controlling my mind beneath the surface. Throughout the whole time, it felt totally normal to me.

How did I act? I'd like to believe I acted normal. People always gave me odd glances, and stared at me behind my back. I felt like they could all tell that I wasn't always the one controlling myself. They seemed to be wary of me. Except for her. She seemed to know and understand everything, its as if she was placed there just for me.

How did I act? I always acted normal. I never felt troubled to fit in, it always worked out. Even though I wasn't always in control, I rarely made a mistake. She was placed there just for me it seemed, it didn't matter who I was. She knew why I was special.

We eventually grew very close, she was very sociable with me, however she never wanted to go to social events with me. She always stayed behind and continued whatever she would be working on at that time. She was the only one who treated me normally.

We eventually grew very close, she was very sociable with me, however she never wanted to go to social events with me. I would eventually end up staying with her more and more rather than go to social events. She said she had a troubled past, and promised that I would never strike her. People always gave me odd glances, I felt like I was never safe.

One day she got sick. We both hoped the sickness would subside within a month. It didn't seem like much, so I kept on working as normal. This went on for several months and I became much less interested in my previous social engagements.

One day she got sick. We both hoped the sickness would subside within a month, but it didn't. I rarely left the house and would work from home - I almost never left her side.

The sickness never improved, even after two years. She never went to see the doctor, she said it wasn't needed. Her sickness imbalanced her body, its as if she had two forces fighting for control of her body. I felt similarly, it seemed as if beneath the surface of my mind I had two forces fighting for control of my mind.

The sickness never improved, even after two years. It seemed to get worse. We never went to see the doctor, it never occurred to us. We didn't know what to do at this point. Her sickness imbalanced her body. She had two forces fighting in her body. I felt similarly, it seemed as if beneath the surface of my mind I had two forces fighting.

She started being more quiet, and less responsive. I could tell she enjoyed my presence. The moments where I could make her smile were the the pinnacle moments of my day. Those moments started coming less and less often.

She started becoming more quiet, and less responsive. We started to keep to our own parts of the house. Even though we inhabited the same area, we drew farther apart. I never felt any of what we had before.
---
My friends said they never met her. They didn't know who she was. I felt more and more distance away from them. They were always looking at me odd. It was becoming harder and harder to make her smile. I was feeling more and more distant from everyone. I was isolated.

My friends said they never met her, and started distancing themselves from me. I realized that I was right all along; they never thought me as part of their group. She and I continued to say in our own worlds. Hers of sickness, and mine of isolation.

The second year of her sickness was the worst. She never smiled anymore, never laughed. If she did try to laugh, she started hacking and coughing. She was constantly tired, yet unable to sleep. She also could barely lift her head to see me. She couldn't move around the house, and was left in her bed. When she spoke to me, it was a slurred mess of words. I never felt more isolated.

On the second anniversary of her sickness she suggested that the sickness really resided inside of me. I thought she understood me, I thought she knew why I was special. I was wrong, she was abandoning me as much as my friends were. I took my car and left. I didn't know what to do, everyone was abandoning me, and not taking my seriously.
---
In October of her second year, she couldn't lost her ability or will to speak. Later that month I couldn't handle it anymore, I left and went states away to where I am now. I left her alone in the house. Only person there to help her was herself, and she didn't even have that anymore.

I then returned in October of her second year. I don't know what I intended on saying to her. Perhaps I thought she would be better. But instead I saw her lying in bed reading, just as sick as before. She said she tried to call, I never got any calls. She was lying to me just as much as my friends were. Eventually it wasn't her sickness that killed her, it was me.

I don't know why I did it, but I couldn't take it anymore. After that day they carted me away, and here I am with you. The people here don't believe me, they say she never existed. You are the only one willing to listen to me.
