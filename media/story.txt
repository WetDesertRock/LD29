This story is one about people and subconscious. I lost social connections, I did things that I would've never thought I could do. It's as if someone was beneath the surface, controlling my mind. The whole time, it felt completely normal to me.

How did I act? I'd like to believe I acted normally despite the fact that people always stared at me behind my back. I felt like they could all tell that I wasn't always the one controlling myself. They seemed to be wary of me. Except for her. She seemed to know and understand everything, its as if she was placed there just for me.

How did I act? I always acted normal. I never felt twice about fitting in, it always worked out. Even though I wasn't always in control, I rarely made mistakes. She was placed there just for me it seemed, it didn't matter who I was. She knew why I was special.

We eventually grew very close, she was very sociable with me, however she never wanted to go to social events with me. She always stayed behind and continued whatever she was working on at the time. She was the only one who treated me normally.

We eventually grew very close, she was very sociable with me, however she never wanted to go to social events with me. I eventually started staying with her more and more rather than going to social events. She said she had a troubled past and made me promise that I would never strike her. Without her, I never felt safe.

One day she got sick. We both hoped the sickness would subside. It didn't seem like much, so I kept on working as normal. This went on for several months and I became much less interested in my social life.

One day she got sick. We both hoped the sickness would subside within a month, but it didn't. I rarely left the house and worked from home - I almost never left her side.

The sickness never improved, even after two years. She never went to see the doctor, she said it wasn't needed. Her sickness imbalanced her body, it's as if she had two forces fighting for control of her body. It was like that with me too. It seemed as if beneath the surface, there were two forces fighting for control of my mind.

The sickness never improved, even after two years. It seemed to get worse. We never went to the doctor, for some reason it never occurred to us. We didn't know what to do at this point. Her sickness imbalanced her body. She had two forces fighting within her body. It was like that with me too. It seemed as if beneath the surface, there were two forces fighting for control of my mind.

She became more quiet and less responsive. I could tell she enjoyed my presence. The moments where I could make her smile were the pinnacle of my day. These moments were becoming more rare.

She became more quiet, and less responsive. We started to keep to our own parts of the house. Even though we inhabited the same area, we drew farther apart and all that we had before was lost.
---
My friends said they never met her. They didn't know who she was. I felt more and more distant from them. They were always looking at me with odd glances. It was becoming harder and harder to make her smile. I was isolated.

My friends said they never met her, and began distancing themselves from me. I realized that I was right all along; they never thought me as part of their group. She and I continued to say in our own worlds. Hers of sickness, and mine of isolation.

The second year of her sickness was the worst. She never smiled anymore, never laughed. Laughter only caused her to start hacking and coughing. She was constantly tired, yet unable to rest. From her bed, she could barely lift her head. She couldn't move around the house. When she spoke, it was a slurred mess of words. I never felt more alone.

On the second anniversary of her sickness she suggested that the sickness really resided inside of me. I thought she understood me, I thought she knew why I was special. I was wrong, she was abandoning me as much as my friends were. I took my car and left. I didn't know what to do, everyone was abandoning me.
---
In October of the second year of sickness, she lost her ability to speak. Or maybe she just didn't care anymore. Later that month I couldn't handle it anymore. I left drive states away. I left her alone in the house. The only person there to help her was herself, and she didn't even have that anymore.

I then returned the same year in October. I don't know what I intended to say to her. Perhaps I thought she would be better. But I was wrong. I saw her lying in bed reading, just as sick as before. She had tried to call, I never gotten any calls. She was lying to me just as much as my friends were. Eventually it wasn't her sickness that killed her, it was me.

I don't know why I did it, but I couldn't handle it anymore. After that day they carted me away to this place. The people here don't believe me, they say she never existed. You are the only one here who's lsitening.
